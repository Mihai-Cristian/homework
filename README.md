This is a Java project that performs user authentication.

The project uses Maven and Spring Boot.

Once started, it will ask for a username and a password, which the user must input manually.

For testing purposes, there are two valid users, which can be found in the application.properties file.

The application checks the username and password; the user has three attempts to input the information correctly, if not, the application will shut down.

I have added a LOG functionality as well.

Use mvn spring-boot:run to start application.
